# All-NBA-Predictor
This project attempted to predict the All-NBA selections using Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron.
The aim for the project was to predict the probability for each player in a given season to be selected in either one of the All-NBA teams.

The data for the project was taken from [Basketball-reference.com](basketball-reference.com). 
The inputs for the models were Advanced Statistics for each players from the 1988-1989 season up to and including the 2020-2021 season.
In order to validate the performance of the best model, the Advanced Statistics for the 2021-2022 season was used to predict the season's All-NBA selection.
